# HopHacks2025 Agent System Setup Guide

## Environment Configuration

The agent system has been improved to work with fallback analysis even without API keys. However, for the best experience, you should configure the following environment variables:

### Required for Full Functionality

1. **GEMINI_API_KEY** - For AI-powered analysis
   - Get your key from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
   - This enables intelligent analysis and scoring

### Optional (Fallback Analysis Available)

2. **WEATHER_API_KEY** - For real-time weather data
   - Get your key from: https://openweathermap.org/api
   - Without this, weather analysis uses seasonal estimates

3. **SUPABASE_URL** and **SUPABASE_KEY** - For data persistence
   - Get your keys from: https://supabase.com
   - Without these, results won't be saved to database

### Setup Steps

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:
```bash
# AI API Keys
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_gemini_api_key_here

# Optional API Keys
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key_here
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
```

2. Restart your development server:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

## What's Fixed

### ✅ Error Handling Improvements
- **AbortError fixes**: Better timeout handling and retry logic
- **API failure fallbacks**: System provides useful analysis even when APIs fail
- **Graceful degradation**: Missing API keys no longer crash the system

### ✅ Enhanced Logging
- Detailed request logging for debugging
- Clear error messages and fallback notifications
- Better visibility into what's happening

### ✅ Fallback Analysis
- **Weather Agent**: Provides seasonal estimates when weather API unavailable
- **Current Events Agent**: Gives competitive analysis based on general knowledge
- **Historical Events Agent**: Uses industry best practices when historical data unavailable
- **Organizer Scoring Agent**: Generates reasonable readiness scores with fallback data

## Testing the System

The system should now work without any API keys configured. Try submitting an event form and you should see:

1. **No more AbortError crashes**
2. **Meaningful fallback analysis** instead of error messages
3. **Clear indicators** when using fallback vs real-time data
4. **Structured responses** that the frontend can display

## Next Steps

1. **Test the system** with the current fallback analysis
2. **Configure API keys** for enhanced functionality
3. **Monitor the logs** to see the improved error handling in action
4. **Provide feedback** on the analysis quality and user experience

The system is now much more robust and user-friendly!
