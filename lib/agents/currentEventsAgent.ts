SEARCH AND ANALYZE:
- Traffic incidents, road closures, construction delays
- Weather emergencies, severe weather warnings, storms
- Local emergencies, accidents, public safety incidents
- Major events, festivals, concerts, protests, gatherings
- Infrastructure issues (power outages, water main breaks, gas leaks)
- Transportation disruptions (airport delays, train cancellations, transit issues)
- Public health alerts, disease outbreaks, advisories
- Government announcements, policy changes affecting the area
- Sports events, entertainment venues with large crowds
- Breaking news that could affect local conditions
